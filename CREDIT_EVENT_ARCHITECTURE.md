# Credit Service Event Architecture - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Overview

The 50BraIns platform now has a complete event-driven architecture that automatically synchronizes credit/boost events across all microservices. When users perform boost actions or credit transactions in the Credit Service, events are published to RabbitMQ and consumed by relevant services to update their local databases.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Credit Service (Publisher)
    ↓ (publishes events)
RabbitMQ Exchange: credit_events
    ↓ (routes to queues)
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│   User Service  │   Gig Service   │  Clan Service   │
│  (Queue: user_  │ (Queue: gig_    │ (Queue: clan_   │
│  credit_queue)  │  credit_queue)  │  credit_queue)  │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### User Service - New Tables:
- **user_boost_events**: Tracks profile boost events received
- **user_credit_events**: Tracks all credit-related events for users

### Gig Service - New Tables:
- **gig_boost_events**: Tracks gig boost events received
- **gig_credit_events**: Tracks credit events related to gigs

### Clan Service - New Tables:
- **clan_boost_events**: Tracks clan boost events received
- **clan_credit_events**: Tracks credit events related to clans

## 🚀 Event Flow Examples

### 1. Profile Boost Event
```javascript
// User boosts another user's profile in Credit Service
POST /api/credits/boost/profile
{
  "targetUserId": "user123",
  "amount": 100,
  "duration": 24
}

// Credit Service publishes event:
{
  "type": "profile_boost",
  "userId": "booster456",
  "targetId": "user123",
  "amount": 100,
  "duration": 24,
  "eventId": "boost_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-29T13:30:00Z"
}

// User Service receives and stores:
- Updates user_boost_events table
- Calculates visibility score boost
- Records boost expiry time
```

### 2. Gig Boost Event
```javascript
// User boosts a gig in Credit Service
POST /api/credits/boost/gig
{
  "targetGigId": "gig789",
  "amount": 200,
  "duration": 48
}

// Event published and Gig Service:
- Stores boost in gig_boost_events
- Updates gig priority/ranking
- Sets boost expiry time
```

### 3. Clan Boost Event
```javascript
// User boosts a clan in Credit Service
POST /api/credits/boost/clan
{
  "targetClanId": "clan456",
  "amount": 300,
  "duration": 72
}

// Event published and Clan Service:
- Stores boost in clan_boost_events
- Updates clan reputation score
- Tracks clan analytics
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### RabbitMQ Configuration
- **Exchange**: `credit_events` (direct exchange)
- **Routing Keys**: 
  - `boost.event` - For all boost-related events
  - `credit.event` - For credit transaction events
- **Queues**:
  - `user_credit_queue` - User Service consumer
  - `gig_credit_queue` - Gig Service consumer
  - `clan_credit_queue` - Clan Service consumer

### Event Types Handled

#### User Service Events:
- `profile_boost` - Profile boost received
- `credit_purchase` - User purchased credits
- `credit_spent` - User spent credits
- `credit_earned` - User earned credits

#### Gig Service Events:
- `gig_boost` - Gig boost received
- `gig_payment` - Payment for gig completion
- `credit_spent` (when targetType=gig) - Credits spent on gigs

#### Clan Service Events:
- `clan_boost` - Clan boost received
- `clan_contribution` - Member contributed to clan
- `credit_spent` (when targetType=clan) - Credits spent on clans

## 🎛️ Service Integration Status

### ✅ Credit Service (Port 4005)

- **Publishing**: Events published for all boost actions
- **Features**: Profile boost, Gig boost, Clan boost, Credit purchases

### ✅ User Service (Port 4002)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready with RabbitMQ consumer
- **Database**: user_boost_events, user_credit_events tables created
- **Consumer**: Handles profile boosts and credit events
- **Features**: Visibility score updates, boost tracking

### ✅ Gig Service (Port 4004)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready with RabbitMQ consumer
- **Database**: gig_boost_events, gig_credit_events tables created
- **Consumer**: Handles gig boosts and related payments
- **Features**: Gig priority updates, boost tracking

### ✅ Clan Service (Port 4003)
- **Status**: ✅ Ready with RabbitMQ consumer
- **Database**: clan_boost_events, clan_credit_events tables created
- **Consumer**: Handles clan boosts and contributions
- **Features**: Reputation updates, analytics tracking

## 🧹 Automated Cleanup

Each service runs hourly cleanup jobs to:
- Mark expired boost events as inactive
- Update visibility/priority scores when boosts expire
- Clean up old event records
- Maintain database performance

## 🚀 Starting the Complete System

### 1. Start RabbitMQ (Required for event flow)
```bash
cd "d:\project\50brains\50BraIns-Server"
docker-compose up rabbitmq -d
```

### 2. Start Credit Service (Publisher)
```bash
cd "d:\project\50brains\50BraIns-Server\services\credit-service"
node src/app.js
```

### 3. Start Consumer Services
```bash
# User Service
cd "d:\project\50brains\50BraIns-Server\services\user-service"
node src/index.js

# Gig Service
cd "d:\project\50brains\50BraIns-Server\services\gig-service"
node src/index.js

# Clan Service
cd "d:\project\50brains\50BraIns-Server\services\clan-service"
node src/index.js
```

## 🧪 Testing the Event Flow

### Test Profile Boost Event:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4005/api/credits/boost/profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>" \
  -d '{
    "targetUserId": "user123",
    "amount": 100,
    "duration": 24
  }'
```

### Monitor Event Processing:
- Check Credit Service logs for event publishing
- Check User Service logs for event consumption
- Verify database records in user_boost_events table

### RabbitMQ Management Interface:
- URL: http://localhost:15672
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

## 📈 Business Impact

### Real-time Synchronization:
- Profile boosts immediately update visibility across User Service
- Gig boosts instantly affect search rankings in Gig Service
- Clan boosts update reputation scores in Clan Service

### Analytics & Tracking:
- Complete audit trail of all boost activities
- Service-specific analytics for boost effectiveness
- Member contribution tracking in clans

### Scalability:
- Event-driven architecture allows independent service scaling
- RabbitMQ handles message queuing and reliability
- Each service maintains its own boost-related data

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Event Replay**: Ability to replay events for data recovery
2. **Event Sourcing**: Complete event history for auditing
3. **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket integration for live boost notifications
4. **Advanced Analytics**: ML-based boost effectiveness analysis
5. **Cross-service Queries**: Federated queries across boost data

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All services are now equipped with:
- ✅ RabbitMQ event consumers
- ✅ Database models for boost tracking
- ✅ Event processing logic
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Automated cleanup jobs
- ✅ Database migrations applied

The entire credit/boost event system is production-ready and will automatically synchronize data across all microservices when RabbitMQ is available.
