## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure `.env` file with actual credentials
2. **Database Migration**: Run Prisma migrations to create database schema
3. **API Gateway Integration**: Add credit service routes to gateway configuration
4. **Service Dependencies**: Ensure User, Gig, and Clan services are running

### Testing Phase
1. Unit testing for all controller methods
2. Integration testing with other services
3. Payment gateway testing with sandbox accounts
4. Load testing for boost operations

### Production Deployment
1. Database migration in production environment
2. Payment gateway webhook configuration
3. SSL certificate setup for secure transactions
4. Monitoring and alerting configuration
