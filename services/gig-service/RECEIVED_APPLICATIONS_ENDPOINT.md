# Received Applications Endpoint Implementation

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

I have successfully implemented the `/api/applications/received` endpoint as requested. Here's what was done:

### üéØ New Endpoint Added

**Route:** `GET /api/applications/received`  
**Purpose:** Fetch all applications received for gigs created by the current user  
**Authentication:** Required (via `requireAuth` middleware)

### üìÅ Files Modified

1. **Controller Logic** (`services/gig-service/src/controllers/gigController.js`)
   - Added `getReceivedApplications` method
   - Includes pagination support (page, limit parameters)
   - Filters applications by user's created gigs
   - Returns full application details with applicant and gig information

2. **Routes** (`services/gig-service/src/routes/applications.js`)
   - Added new route: `router.get('/received', requireAuth, asyncHandler(gigController.getReceivedApplications))`
   - Route is properly protected with authentication middleware

### üîß Implementation Details

#### Controller Method Features:
- **Pagination**: Supports `page` and `limit` query parameters
- **User Context**: Uses `req.user.id` from authentication headers
- **Data Enrichment**: Returns applications with:
  - Applicant details (id, email, profile info)
  - Associated gig information (title, description, etc.)
  - Application status and timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Proper validation and error responses

#### Sample Response Structure:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "receivedApplications": [
    {
      "id": "app-123",
      "status": "pending",
      "appliedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "coverLetter": "I'm interested in this opportunity...",
      "applicant": {
        "id": "user-456",
        "email": "applicant@example.com",
        "profile": { /* user profile data */ }
      },
      "gig": {
        "id": "gig-789",
        "title": "Content Creation for Brand X",
        "description": "Looking for influencers...",
        "budget": 1000
      }
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 25,
    "totalPages": 3
  }
}
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Middleware

- **Authentication**: Route protected by `requireAuth` middleware
- **User Context**: Automatically extracts user info from headers (set by API Gateway)
- **Authorization**: Only shows applications for gigs created by the authenticated user

### üåê API Gateway Integration

The endpoint will be accessible through the API Gateway at:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/applications/received
```

With proper JWT authentication headers, the API Gateway will:
1. Validate the JWT token
2. Extract user information
3. Set `x-user-id`, `x-user-email`, and `x-user-role` headers
4. Forward the request to the gig service

### üìã Usage Example

```javascript
// Frontend API call
const response = await fetch('/api/applications/received?page=1&limit=10', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.receivedApplications);
```

### üöÄ Ready for Testing

The implementation is complete and ready for:
1. **Service Testing**: Start the gig service and test the endpoint
2. **Frontend Integration**: Update frontend to consume this new endpoint
3. **E2E Testing**: Test through the API Gateway with proper authentication

### üìù Next Steps

1. Start the gig service: `npm start` in the gig-service directory
2. Test the endpoint through the API Gateway
3. Integrate with frontend components for displaying received applications
4. Add frontend pagination controls if needed

The endpoint provides all the functionality requested for viewing applications received on gigs created by the current user, with proper authentication, pagination, and detailed response data.
