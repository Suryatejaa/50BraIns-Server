# API Gateway

## Overview
The API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all client requests in the 50BraIns platform. It handles request routing, authentication, rate limiting, security, and proxies requests to appropriate microservices.

**Port:** 3000  
**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`

## Security Features
- **Helmet.js**: Comprehensive security headers
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Multiple layers of request throttling
- **Input Validation**: Request sanitization and validation
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth middleware
- **HPP Protection**: HTTP Parameter Pollution prevention
- **Compression**: Response compression for optimization

## Rate Limiting Configuration

### Global Rate Limiting
- **Window:** 15 minutes
- **Max Requests:** 1000 per IP
- **Headers:** Includes rate limit info in response headers

### Auth-Specific Rate Limiting  
- **Window:** 15 minutes
- **Max Requests:** 50 per IP
- **Applied to:** All `/api/auth/*` routes

### Speed Limiting
- **Window:** 1 minute  
- **Max Requests:** 100 per IP
- **Purpose:** Prevent rapid-fire requests

## Core Endpoints

  "services": {
    "auth": { "url": "http://localhost:4001", "timeout": 30000 },
    "user": { "url": "http://localhost:4002", "timeout": 30000 },
    "clan": { "url": "http://localhost:4003", "timeout": 30000 },
    "gig": { "url": "http://localhost:4004", "timeout": 30000 },
    "credit": { "url": "http://localhost:4005", "timeout": 30000 },
    "reputation": { "url": "http://localhost:4006", "timeout": 30000 },
    "workHistory": { "url": "http://localhost:4007", "timeout": 30000 },
    "socialMedia": { "url": "http://localhost:4008", "timeout": 30000 },
    "notification": { "url": "http://localhost:4009", "timeout": 30000 }
  }
}
```

### Request Flow
1. **Client Request** → API Gateway
2. **Security Checks** (CORS, rate limiting, validation)
3. **Authentication** (if required)
4. **Route Resolution** (determine target service)
5. **Proxy Request** → Target Service
6. **Response Processing** → Client

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Request Metrics Collection
- Request count per endpoint
- Response times
- Error rates
- Active connections
- Service health status

### Logging Configuration
- **Development**: Console logging with detailed output
- **Production**: File-based logging with rotation
- **Log Levels**: Error, Warn, Info, Debug
- **Request Logging**: All requests logged with timestamps and user agents

*This completes the API Gateway documentation. Would you like me to proceed with the Auth Service documentation next?*
```

I've created the comprehensive API Gateway documentation covering:

1. **Overview & Configuration**
2. **Security Features** 
3. **Rate Limiting** (3 different layers)
4. **Core Endpoints** (health, api-docs)
5. **Public Routes** (30+ endpoints organized by service)
6. **Protected Routes** (40+ endpoints requiring authentication)
7. **Error Handling** with standard formats
8. **Service Discovery & Routing**
9. **Monitoring & Metrics**

This gives you a complete picture of the API Gateway's capabilities and all available routes.

**Should I proceed with the Auth Service documentation next?** The Auth Service includes:
- User registration/login
- JWT token management
- Password reset
- Email verification
- Role-based access control
- Admin operations

Let me know if you want me to continue with the Auth Service or if you need any modifications to the Gateway documentation!Summarizing conversation history...Understood perfectly! I'll create a comprehensive documentation file for the entire 50BraIns backend ecosystem. Let me start with the API Gateway and then proceed service by service with your confirmation.
