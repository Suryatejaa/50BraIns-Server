# 🔧 WebSocket Gateway Duplicate Upgrade Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

The WebSocket Gateway was experiencing **duplicate upgrade handling** errors:
```
[ERROR] Error in WebSocket upgrade {"error":"server.handleUpgrade() was called more than once with the same socket, possibly due to a misconfiguration"}
```

This caused:
- Multiple connection attempts for the same user
- Immediate disconnections with code 1006
- Unstable WebSocket connections
- Service instability

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was caused by:
1. **Duplicate Log Statements** - Two identical log calls in `initialize()` method
2. **Multiple Initialization Calls** - `initializeWebSocket()` being called multiple times
3. **Event Listener Duplication** - Upgrade event handlers being registered multiple times
4. **Missing Initialization Guards** - No protection against re-initialization

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Removed Duplicate Log Statement**
```javascript
// Before: Duplicate logging
logger.logConnection('WebSocket Gateway initialized', { port: server.address()?.port || 'unknown' });
logger.logConnection('WebSocket Gateway initialized', { port: server.address()?.port || 'unknown' });

// After: Single log statement
logger.logConnection('WebSocket Gateway initialized', { port: server.address()?.port || 'unknown' });
```

### 2. **Added Initialization Guards**
```javascript
// In WebSocketGateway.initialize()
if (this.wss) {
    logger.logWarn('WebSocket Gateway already initialized, skipping');
    return;
}

// In WebSocketGatewayService.initializeWebSocket()
if (this.app.locals.wsGateway) {
    logger.logWarn('WebSocket Gateway already initialized, skipping');
    return;
}
```

### 3. **Added Initialization Status Check**
```javascript
/**
 * Check if WebSocket Gateway is initialized
 */
isInitialized() {
    return !!this.wss;
}
```

### 4. **Enhanced Reset Capability**
```javascript
/**
 * Reset WebSocket Gateway (for testing/debugging)
 */
reset() {
    this.close();
    this.wss = null;
    logger.logConnection('WebSocket Gateway reset');
}
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Step 1: Restart the Service**
```bash
cd services/websocket-gateway
# Stop the service (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Check for Duplicate Errors**
Look for these logs (should NOT appear):
- ❌ `"server.handleUpgrade() was called more than once"`
- ❌ Multiple `"WebSocket Gateway initialized"` messages
- ❌ Multiple connection attempts for same user

### **Step 3: Test with Node.js Script**
```bash
# Run the test script
node test-gateway-connection.js
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing WebSocket Gateway Connection...

🔗 Connecting user: test-user-1
✅ test-user-1: Connected successfully
📤 test-user-1: Sent ping message
📥 test-user-1: Received: connected
📥 test-user-1: Received: pong
✅ test-user-1: Ping-pong successful

🔗 Connecting user: test-user-2
✅ test-user-2: Connected successfully
...

🏥 Testing health endpoints...
✅ Health endpoint: healthy
✅ RabbitMQ health: healthy
✅ WebSocket health: healthy
```

### **Step 4: Test with HTML Client**
Use `test-websocket-gateway.html`:
1. **Open** in browser
2. **Connect** to `ws://localhost:4000/ws`
3. **Verify** stable connection
4. **Test** message sending

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix**

1. ✅ **Single Initialization** - Only one "WebSocket Gateway initialized" log
2. ✅ **Stable Connections** - No duplicate upgrade errors
3. ✅ **Proper Connection Handling** - Each user gets one stable connection
4. ✅ **Health Endpoints Working** - All health checks return proper status
5. ✅ **Message Processing** - Ping/pong and other messages work correctly

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

If you still see issues:

### **Check Service Logs**
```bash
# Look for initialization patterns
grep "WebSocket Gateway initialized" services/websocket-gateway/logs/*.log

# Look for duplicate upgrade errors
grep "handleUpgrade.*called more than once" services/websocket-gateway/logs/*.log
```

### **Verify Single Instance**
```bash
# Check if multiple processes are running
ps aux | grep "websocket-gateway"
```

### **Test Health Endpoints**
```bash
# Verify service is healthy
curl http://localhost:4000/health
curl http://localhost:4000/health/rabbitmq
curl http://localhost:4000/health/websocket
```

### **Reset and Retry**
If issues persist:
1. **Stop** the service
2. **Wait** 5 seconds
3. **Restart** the service
4. **Test** with the Node.js script first

## 🚀 **Long-term Benefits**

With these fixes, your WebSocket Gateway now provides:
- **Stable Connections** - No more duplicate upgrade errors
- **Reliable Initialization** - Single, controlled startup sequence
- **Better Error Handling** - Clear logging and status tracking
- **Production Ready** - Robust connection management
- **Easy Debugging** - Clear initialization and status methods

The WebSocket Gateway is now properly handling multiple connections without the duplicate upgrade issues! 🎉
