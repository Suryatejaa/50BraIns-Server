- `user.settings.changed` - Settings changes
- `user.contact.toggled` - Contact visibility changes
- `user.portfolio.updated` - Portfolio updates

### 2. Auth Service Events
Auth Service only publishes registration events:

**Missing Events:**

- `user.logout` - Logout events
- `user.password_reset` - Password reset events
- `user.email_verified` - Email verification
- `user.account_locked` - Account security events
- `user.account_banned` - Account moderation events

### 3. Equipment Service
**Status:** NOT ANALYZED
**Need to check:** Equipment-related events like:
- `equipment.added`
- `equipment.updated`
- `equipment.deleted`
- `equipment.maintenance.due`

## Recommendations

   - Add maintenance notification events

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Analytics Events**

2. **Add Admin Events**
