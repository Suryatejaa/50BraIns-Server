# Complete Gig Delivery Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the complete end-to-end workflow for gig delivery, credit rewards, and work history tracking in the 50BraIns platform. The system integrates three core services:

1. **Gig Service** - Manages gig lifecycle and work submissions
2. **Credit Service** - Handles credit rewards and user wallets
3. **Work History Service** - Tracks completed work and user achievements

## Workflow Overview

```
User Applies → Brand Approves → User Completes Work → User Submits → Brand Reviews → 
Work Approved → Credits Awarded → Work History Created → User Account Boosted
```

## Detailed Workflow Steps

### 1. User Applies to Gig
- User submits application with proposal and pricing
- Application stored in gig service
- Event: `application_submitted` published

### 2. Brand Approves Application
- Brand reviews and accepts user's application
- Gig status changes to `ASSIGNED`
- User becomes the assigned worker
- Event: `application_accepted` published

### 3. User Completes Work
- User works on the gig according to requirements
- User uploads deliverables to social media or specified platforms
- Work is completed according to gig specifications

### 4. User Submits Work
- User calls `POST /gigs/:id/submit` endpoint
- Submission includes:
  - Title and description of work
  - Links to deliverables
  - Any additional notes
- Gig status changes to `SUBMITTED`
- Event: `work_submitted` published

### 5. Brand Reviews Submission
- Brand reviews the submitted work
- Brand can:
  - **Approve**: Work meets requirements
  - **Request Revision**: Work needs changes
  - **Reject**: Work doesn't meet requirements
- Brand provides rating (1-5 stars) and feedback
- Event: `submission_reviewed` published

### 6. Work Approval and Completion
- If approved:
  - Gig status changes to `COMPLETED`
  - Event: `gig_completed` published
  - Credit reward calculation triggered
  - Work history record created
- If revision requested:
  - Gig status reverts to `IN_PROGRESS`
  - User can resubmit work
- If rejected:
  - Gig status reverts to `ASSIGNED`
  - Gig can be reassigned to another user

## Credit Reward System

### Reward Calculation
Credits are automatically awarded when a gig is completed and approved:

```javascript
// Base reward: 10% of gig budget (minimum 5 credits)
baseReward = Math.max(5, Math.floor(avgBudget * 0.1));

// Rating bonus: 20% for 4+ stars, 10% for 3+ stars
ratingBonus = rating >= 4 ? baseReward * 0.2 : 
              rating >= 3 ? baseReward * 0.1 : 0;

// Complexity bonus: 2 credits per required skill (max 5)
complexityBonus = Math.min(5, skills.length * 2);

totalReward = baseReward + ratingBonus + complexityBonus;
```

### Credit Award Process
1. **Gig Service** calculates reward amount
2. **Credit Service** receives award request via `POST /credits/award`
3. **Credit Service** creates transaction and updates user wallet
4. **Event**: `CREDITS_AWARDED` published
5. User's account balance increases
6. User's reputation and visibility improve

## Work History Integration

### Automatic Work Record Creation
When a gig is completed:

1. **Gig Service** calls `POST /work-history/work-records`
2. **Work History Service** creates comprehensive work record including:
   - Gig details (title, description, category)
   - Skills used and required
   - Client rating and feedback
   - Delivery time and budget compliance
   - Portfolio items and deliverables
3. **Work History Service** updates user's work summary
4. **Work History Service** checks for new achievements
5. **Work History Service** updates skill proficiencies

### Work Record Data Structure
```javascript
{
  userId: "worker_user_id",
  gigId: "completed_gig_id",
  clientId: "brand_user_id",
  title: "Gig Title",
  description: "Gig Description",
  category: "Content Creation",
  skills: ["Copywriting", "Social Media"],
  completedAt: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  deliveryTime: "2 days",
  budgetRange: "100-200",
  actualBudget: 150,
  clientRating: 5,
  clientFeedback: "Excellent work!",
  onTimeDelivery: true,
  withinBudget: true,
  portfolioItems: [...]
}
```

## Service Integration Points

### Gig Service → Credit Service
- **Endpoint**: `POST /credits/award`
- **Purpose**: Award credits for completed gigs
- **Data**: User ID, amount, type, description, metadata

### Gig Service → Work History Service
- **Endpoint**: `POST /work-history/work-records`
- **Purpose**: Create work history records
- **Data**: Complete work completion data

### Event Publishing
All services publish events to RabbitMQ for real-time updates:

- `work_submitted` - Work submitted for review
- `submission_reviewed` - Work reviewed by brand
- `gig_completed` - Gig successfully completed
- `CREDITS_AWARDED` - Credits added to user wallet
- `work.completed` - Work history record created

## API Endpoints

### Gig Service
```
POST /gigs/:id/submit          # Submit completed work
POST /submissions/:id/review   # Review submission (approve/reject)
```

### Credit Service
```
POST /credits/award            # Award credits to user
GET  /credits/wallet          # Get user wallet balance
GET  /credits/transactions    # Get transaction history
```

### Work History Service
```
POST /work-history/work-records    # Create work record
GET  /work-history/user/:userId    # Get user's work history
GET  /work-history/user/:userId/summary  # Get work summary
```

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Fallback Mechanisms
- If credit service is unavailable, gig completion continues
- If work history service is unavailable, gig completion continues
- Failed operations are logged and can be retried
- Events are published even if external service calls fail

### Transaction Safety
- Credit operations use database transactions
- Work history creation is atomic
- Gig status updates are consistent

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Gig completion rate
- Average credit rewards
- Work quality ratings
- Delivery time performance
- User satisfaction scores

### Logging
All operations are logged with structured data:
- Service identification
- Operation timestamps
- Success/failure status
- Error details
- Performance metrics

## Security Considerations

### Service-to-Service Communication
- Internal service endpoints protected by service headers
- API keys for cross-service authentication
- Rate limiting on external endpoints
- Input validation on all endpoints

### User Data Protection
- User IDs are validated before processing
- Credit amounts are validated and limited
- Work history data is sanitized
- Audit trails for all credit transactions

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Complete Workflow Test**
   - Submit work → Review → Approve → Award credits → Create work history

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Rejection handling
   - Revision requests
   - Service failures
   - Invalid data

3. **Performance Tests**
   - High-volume gig completions
   - Concurrent credit awards
   - Database transaction performance

### Test Files
- `test-gig-workflow.js` - Complete workflow testing
- `test-credit-rewards.js` - Credit system testing
- `test-work-history.js` - Work history integration testing

## Deployment Considerations

```

### Service Dependencies
- All services must be running for complete functionality
